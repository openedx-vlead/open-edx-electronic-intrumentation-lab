<h1 style="color: #990000;">Objective of the Experiment</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">To study the dynamic performance characteristics of the first-order system by obtaining the responses to the following test inputs: Unit impulse, unit step, unit ramp, and sine wave (frequency response).</p>
<h1 style="color: #990000;">Overview</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">In this experiment you can choose a system specified by its transfer function, first-order system and determine its response to standard test inputs like unit impulse, unit step, unit ramp and sine wave. The responses to impulse, step, and ramp inputs are plotted in time domain, while the response to swept-frequency sine wave gives the frequency response. In addition, this experiment allows you to explore responses for any system including systems which may not be practical, by specifying the system in its transfer function form.</p>
