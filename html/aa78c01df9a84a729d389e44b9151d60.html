<p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">To observe and model the interference that is coupled to an electronic system via the electric field existing between the two systems.</p>
<h1 style="color: #990000;">Overview</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Two systems are considered (A and B). The signal generated by Systems A is coupled electrically to System B and thereby becomes an interference resulting in a noisy output from System B. This experiment determines how interference is generated and coupled to an electronic system and the factors influencing the amount of noise coupled.</p>
